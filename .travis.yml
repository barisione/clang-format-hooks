# We need Python 3 for the tests, but, if we add Python 3 here, it will be installed
# in a virtualenv where bin/python points to Python 3.
# Then "python clang-format-diff" is spawned and this ends up using Python 2 instead
# of the required Python 2.7.
# So we create the virtualenv with Python 2.7 and install manually Python 3 which
# will be used by the tests.
# This is hacky, but good enough to get stuff running.
